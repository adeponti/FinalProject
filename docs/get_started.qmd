# Getting started with `realestateCH`

This page shows a minimal end-to-end example of how to use the
**realestateCH** package with the project data.

We will:

1. Load the raw rent dataset  
2. Clean the data  
3. Compute rent price per square meter  
4. Create a simple plot by canton  

---

## 1. Import the main functions

```python
from realestateCH.load import load_data
from realestateCH.clean import clean_data
from realestateCH.metrics import compute_rent_per_m2
from realestateCH.plots import plot_average_rent_per_canton
```

---

## 2. Load the rent dataset

Here we use the file `data_raw/Total-Rent.csv` that was collected in Role 1.

```python
rent_df = load_data("data_raw/Total-Rent.csv")
```

---

## 3. Clean the data

We apply the cleaning logic defined in the package:
numeric conversion, removal of invalid rows, duplicates, etc.

```python
clean_rent_df = clean_data(rent_df)
```

---

## 4. Compute rent per square meter

```python
clean_rent_df["rent_per_m2"] = compute_rent_per_m2(clean_rent_df)
```

---

## 5. Plot average rent per canton

Finally, we create a simple bar plot that shows the average
rent price per m² for each canton.

```python
plot_average_rent_per_canton(clean_rent_df)
```

This basic workflow is the starting point for more advanced analysis
and for the interactive dashboard developed in Role 3.
