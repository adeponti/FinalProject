# Examples

Here are a few practical examples showing how to use the functions
included in the **realestateCH** Python package.

These examples can be adapted directly in Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts,
or in the dashboard built in Role 3.

---

## Example 1 — Load and clean both datasets (Rent + Buy)

```python
from realestateCH.load import load_data
from realestateCH.clean import clean_data

rent = load_data("data_raw/Total-Rent.csv")
buy = load_data("data_raw/Total-Buy.csv")

rent = clean_data(rent)
buy = clean_data(buy)
```

---

## Example 2 — Compute rent per m² and price per m²

```python
from realestateCH.metrics import (
    compute_rent_per_m2,
    compute_buy_price_per_m2
)

rent["rent_per_m2"] = compute_rent_per_m2(rent)
buy["price_per_m2"] = compute_buy_price_per_m2(buy)
```

---

## Example 3 — Merge datasets by ZIP code

```python
merged = rent.merge(
    buy,
    on="zip_code",
    how="inner",
    suffixes=("_rent", "_buy")
)
```

---

## Example 4 — Compute price-to-rent ratio

```python
from realestateCH.metrics import price_to_rent_ratio

ratio_df = price_to_rent_ratio(buy, rent)
ratio_df.head()
```

---

## Example 5 — Plot rent distribution

```python
from realestateCH.plots import plot_rent_distribution

plot_rent_distribution(rent)
```

---

## Example 6 — Plot comparison between cantons

```python
from realestateCH.plots import (
    plot_average_rent_per_canton,
    plot_average_buy_price_per_canton
)

plot_average_rent_per_canton(rent)
plot_average_buy_price_per_canton(buy)
```

These examples illustrate the core operations supported by the package:
loading, cleaning, merging, computing metrics, and visualizing real estate data.
